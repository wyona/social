#friendsPane {
  /**
   * The goal here is to line up friends in columns that the user never has
   * to scroll vertically, just horizontally.
   *
   * But setting overflow-x to either "auto" or "scroll" seems to force
   * overflow-y to "auto", and the column code then prioritizes vertical
   * scrolling over horizontal scrolling (i.e. if there's not enough space
   * to fit multiple columns in the pane, the code makes the content
   * into one long column that you have to scroll vertically instead of
   * multiple columns that you have to scroll horizontally).
   * 
   * The docs say you can do it by setting an explicit "height" (see
   * http://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/CSS3_Columns#Height_Balancing
   * for the details), but that doesn't seem to work for me.
